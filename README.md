## 📸 Overview

RBRIZZ Distance Map is a browser-based tool that overlays competition field images and lets you:

- 📏 Click to draw measurement lines across the field
- 🔄 Instantly calculate wheel rotations and degrees for any path
- 🧭 Use Odometry Mode to track X/Y position relative to an origin point
- 📐 Visualize right-triangle breakdowns of diagonal paths
- 🗓️ Switch between competition years (2023–2026) and categories

## 🎮 How to Use

### 📏 Distance Measurement

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1️⃣ | **Click** on the canvas to set the **start point** |
| 2️⃣ | **Move** your mouse — live measurements appear in the sidebar |
| 3️⃣ | **Click again** to lock the **end point** |
| 4️⃣ | A new line is saved; repeat to draw more |
| 🖱️ Right-click | Cancels the current line |

### 🔢 Measurements Shown

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| 📏 Distance | Straight-line distance in mm |
| 📐 Angle | Absolute angle from horizontal (°) |
| 🔄 Wheel Rotations | Full rotations needed for your wheel diameter |
| 🔵 Wheel Degrees | Motor degrees needed |
| ↔️ Horizontal | X-axis component (mm) |
| ↕️ Vertical | Y-axis component (mm) |

### ⚙️ Wheel Diameter

Enter your robot's wheel diameter (in mm) in the **top control bar**.  
Default: `62.4 mm`

> 🧮 The tool recalculates wheel rotations and degrees automatically.

## 🧭 Odometry Mode

Odometry Mode helps you plan and visualize robot position relative to a **custom origin point**.

### How to activate:

1. Check ✅ **Odometry Mode** in the sidebar
2. **Click** on the field to set your **origin (0, 0)**
3. Use **Add Point** or **Add Line** to mark robot positions and paths

### Odometry Sidebar shows:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| X | Horizontal distance from origin (mm) |
| Y | Vertical distance from origin (mm, upward positive) |
| Angle | Direction from origin (°) |

## 🏟️ Field Selection

Use the dropdowns in the **header** to choose:

| Selector | Options |
|---|---|
| 📅 Year | 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 |
| 🏆 Category | Elementary, Junior, Senior, RoboSports |

> Field images load from `GameField/<year>/<category>.png`. If an image is missing, the tool gracefully falls back to a grid-only view.

**Field dimensions:** `2362 mm × 1143 mm`  
**Max robot size:** `250 mm × 250 mm`
